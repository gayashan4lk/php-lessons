Hello,
I found your Sales Training Deck job post and I’m very interested in
your project. As a certified Microsoft professional with experience
developing compelling presentations, I think you’ll find I have the skills
you’re looking for.
Please take a look at my portfolio to get an idea of the kind of
presentations I have developed. Typically, I can edit and design a
20-page presentation like yours within three hours. I’m wrapping up
a project now and will have availability beginning tomorrow.
I do have a few questions about the requirements and would be open
to an interview. I will be online for the next 2 hours if you would like to
discuss. Otherwise, please let me know what times work for you.
Thank you for your consideration,
Joe
